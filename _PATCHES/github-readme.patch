+This is the source repository for the TDM-GCC binutils and GDB binaries,
+including patches.

+release tag.
+

+binutils patches, or its commit history.
+
+Check the `_PATCHES` folder on the `tdm-patches-gdb.public` branch for GDB
+patches, or its commit history.
+
+All patches are maintained via the [StGit](http://www.procode.org/stgit/)
+plugin. The published `.public` branches on Github are merge-friendly, so you
+can pull and merge changes from them without worrying about rewritten history.
